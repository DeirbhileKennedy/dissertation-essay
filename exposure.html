There have been many queries on whether it is acceptable to expose young children to technology, whether this be phones, tablets and computers at home or in school. Technology can become very important in the development of children as recent studies show</p>
    
    <blockquote><p1>“The active use of technology and screen time can actually help develop and improve your children’s learning.”[3]<br>
            <cite>—Digiparenthood, Raising digital natives, August 23, 2013, </cite></p1></blockquote>
    
    <p>However, this can only be effective when used appropriately. Children are constantly surrounded be technology nowadays, so why not integrate this with teaching rather than look at it as a burden or distraction. 
</p>
    
    
<p>Research shows that 25% of 0-2-year-olds and 36% of 3-5-year-olds own an iPad, and that the number of under-fives using tablets and computers has increased by 170% since 2012.[4]
With the developments in technology growing at a fast rate, we now have generations of children that are exposed to technology that no past generations were exposed too.
Modern technology has provided children will online books, videos and learning tools to help them in the future.

Nonetheless, the decision when a child should be introduced to technology such as phones, laptops and tablet should be made by the parents and when they feel is most appropriate.
</p>
    
<p>The early use of technology can improve children’s language skills. Active screen time can help develop this. The use of eBooks and online reading through tablets or computers can allow children to learn and pronounce new words that they may struggle with. This in turn can expand their vocabulary and help accelerate their reading at school. </p>
    
<p>The use of technology can play a crucial part in supporting early language in kids. This can create more engagement and interaction between children, giving them the appropriate words and language to develop conversations between each other and improve their social skills. 
While this can be extremely beneficial for children before starting school when used effectively, early years specialists and experts agree that “apps and digital technology should not be used as a replacement to face-to-face interaction but rather as a tool to supplement teaching and learning.”[5]
This is very important to take into consideration as the overuse of technology can prevent children with the face-to-face element of language and communication between them and their parents.
This is turn can enhance their social interaction skills. As their language skills develop so does their social skills. They have the ability to consume ideas that allow them to relate to other children. With the appropriate use of technology, it can be used in collaboration with other people. 
Children can be given the chance to write and solve problems together, through the use of games and apps. Problem solving is valuable social skill to be carried through life.
</p>
    
        
<p>Exposure to technology before school can also promote their school readiness and cognitive development. This can provide children with opportunities to gain new skills, preparing them for school. There are many appropriate computer and tablet programs and apps that enhance a children’s readiness to learn subjects such as math and reading. 
</p>
    
<p>When children are exposed to this technology there are many ways in which this helps them develop problem-solving skills at a young age. Certain apps and games face children with obstacles forcing them to problem solve and not try and find an easy way out of it. Short-term goals are more of an interest to children, which can be very helpful in the learning of maths. 
With more and more children being exposed to technology from a young age especially through gaming this has enhance their capacity for visual attention allowing them to pay more attention to detail In their work in order to complete activities and goals. 
Interactive media can be used to discover and explore a child’s talent. Being exposed to music, writing or art online through apps and websites can develop an interest which may see your child becoming competent at these activities.
</p>
    
<p>Lastly, exposing your children to technology from an early age is a way to build discipline and self-motivation, which are two factors that are very important in a child’s development. Many tablet apps and games encourage a child to finish a level to move onto the next. This can create a foundation to get children to keep trying in order to succeed even outside the screen setting. 
Exposure to these educational apps challenges a child to push themselves harder and strive for the best. Therefore they begin to develop a disciplined mindset which can be transferred into real-life situations
