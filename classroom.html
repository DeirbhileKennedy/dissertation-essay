<p>Children are more interested and engaged with technology now. Therefore this can create many new opportunities in the classroom to learn, making teaching more fun and effective, engaging the students in the lessons  
This section is going to explain the benefits of using technology in the classroom and what techniques are most effective compared to the traditional teaching methods.
</p>
    
    
<p>Technology can encourage individual learning as it will allow and give children the opportunity to learn at their own speed. If some children are struggling they can review difficult concepts and get help, while faster learners have the opportunity to skip on ahead. Not every child learns the same way, some struggle or are slower at learning than others, therefore having the chance to learn and complete tasks at your own pace can be very beneficial for certain children. 
Technology has been helpful to children with learning disabilities. Certain apps, games and online resources can build the skills that some children lack as well as allow them to learn at their own pace as stated above. With the introduction of technology this has not only aided special needs children in school but also in the community, helping them participate in ways that were previously not possible.
</p>
    
<p>Appropriate use of technology can greatly enhance a child’s ability to access learning material themselves, whether this be games, or a particular program/app without depending on a parent or teacher. This in turn promotes their individual learning. Self directed learning is becoming the mantra for better learning.[6]</p>
    
<p>There are ways which technology can support independence for learning in children. Technology today has numerous resources for children to use for independent learning at home when they are not in school to encourage this.
As well as Individual learning, technology can offer the opportunity for collaborative learning. Allowing children to get involved activities together and work in teams on certain tasks. </p>
    
    
   <blockquote><p1>“Technology overcomes all barriers, makes learning fun and accessible therefore increasing achievement. I don't know of any learner today who doesn't like going on a computer, having a phone, iPod, iPhone or a laptop, they pick things up almost instinctively so they can be like everyone else”[7]<br>
      <cite>—Santosh Bhaskar K, “How Technology Promotes Independent Learning?” EdTechReview, July 8 2013 </cite></p1></blockquote>
    
    
<p>When technology is integrated into lessons this can increase the engagement between students in the classroom, therefore making them more interested in the subject they are learning. Delivering lessons through gamification can be a fun way the interact with the children, gamification of certain subjects such as maths can be an interesting way to get children to participate in the lesson and achieve goals but making it more enjoyable. 
Because of this, interest and involvement in a certain lesson can create an increase in the children’s knowledge and retention. Having engaging and interactive ways of learning can help a child retain more of that knowledge, some might think back to memorable or fun lesson they had on a specific subject helping them remember certain information from that lesson.
</p>
    
<p>Using technology in learning can provide children with useful life skills. Not only do children learn through technology, teachers also have enhanced skills in the using of technology, which can be very beneficial in the 21st century. “Modern learning is about collaborating with others, solving complex problems, critical thinking, developing different forms of communication and leadership skills, and improving motivation and productivity.”[8]</p>
    
<p>All of these points have been achieved through the use of technology at home and in school, setting them up for the future to be successful. 

As well as helping students there can be a benefits for teachers also. With so many online resources to choose from this can help a teacher make their lesson more interactive and engaging compared to that of traditional teaching methods . Using virtual lessons, apps or online assessments can save teachers a lot of time in the classroom. This means there will be time to help those who are struggling in the class, spending more time on which particular method of teaching helps them most. 
</p>
    
    
<p>Teachers can spend hours marking papers, going over homework, which can take up time in the classroom and at home. However with so many resources available online there are many opportunities for teachers to cut down this process by automated grading. This can create more time for the teacher to develop with exciting and interacting lessons to help all in the classroom. 

With the use of learning management systems (LMS) students have the ability to access learning materials to get assistance on demand if they are not in a teaching environment and need. Extra help. LMS is “is a platform that helps instructors manage and organize educational materials online and conduct online lessons”[9]</p>
    
<p>Are educational apps really effective in learning? Studies revealed that since the release of Apple’s iPad in April of 2010, students using iPads scored much higher on literacy tests than students that didn’t use the device.[10]
A piece of technology equipped with educational apps can be very useful and aid children in the learning process. 
With educational apps being the second most popular category in the app store in 2013, shows that educational apps are shaping the future. 
As well as students, apps can help the educators, teachers can use these apps as teaching aids and interactive materials. Interactive eBooks can be used as teaching materials, with maths, reading comprehensions etc. 
Children love using educational apps, as it creates a fun way of learning. Sometimes teachers can struggle getting children to concentrate in lessons, but it can be very easy to get them to interact with a tablet or device. With the use of educational apps, this is a way to promote interest in topics that children might otherwise not be interested in.
</p>
    
<p>Education doesn’t stop at the end of a school day with most children going home with homework. The contribution of a parent in the teaching of their children can be a major factor. Many parents have a very busy schedules and therefore some don’t have the time to sit with their children and help with their homework which is why online learning through technology is another benefit. If there is a certain app being used in the classroom for learning this can be used at home to assist children when doing homework, in turn keeping them up to date with schoolwork. </p>
