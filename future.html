    <h3>Are classrooms nowadays outdated? In 20 years time will there even be such things as a classroom? </h3>
    
    
    
    <p>The classroom as we know it has rapidly changed since the early 2000’s, with most schools now having replaced traditional blackboards with interactive whiteboards. </p>
    
    
    <p>But are blackboards a thing of the past? At one point, blackboards where one of the most revolutionary tools  in education. They had a huge impact on the efficiency within a classroom. The use of  blackboards dates back to ancient times where students inscribed their lessons onto clay tablets with a stylus. Up to the end of the 18th century slates or pieces of wood where still used in the classroom. Ink and paper where expensive at this time and not used as much.</p>
    
    <p>In 1801, James Pillans, headmaster and geography teacher at the Old High School in Edinburgh, Scotland, was the first to hang a huge slate on the wall of the classroom.[11] From here on in the mid 19th century many schools in different countries rapidly adopted this new innovation which made an enormous impact in classrooms to this day.</p>
    
  <p>When the colour of the board was no longer black it was given the name “chalkboard”
 “In the 1980s the whiteboard, or dry erase board, began to become common and by the mid-1990s 21% of American schools were using them.”[12]

In older schools chalkboards are still common however newer schools have brought in the use of dry erase boards due to their ease of use, but some critics, argue that the slickness of the whiteboard makes it harder for young students to write on. </p>
    
    
    <p>Interactive whiteboards are what the future holds, allowing children to all interact at once. They are slowly replacing the use of traditional blackboards. There are many reasons why interactive white boards are so beneficial for children’s learning.
Firstly it allows multiple children to interact with the screen at once allowing them to learn as a group. This includes writing on, interacting in games and voting on answers with the help of handheld devices.[13] This facilitates active learning and keeps children engaged in a lesson. </p>
    

    <p>Teachers believe this is a more fun and interactive way of learning. It also provides the ability to save lessons and go back later if needed, whereas once a blackboard is erased there was no way to go back to that lesson.  It makes the review or revision of that lesson more convenient. Whiteboards can provide the teacher with an opportunity to share screen, text, audio and video files with students. Those in higher education can really benefit from this form of interaction. Recording lessons is another advantage the whiteboard can bring. This can provide a more convenient reference point during revision, which makes revising  easier. That can result in better understanding, quicker learning and improved performance.[14]</p>
    
    
    <p>The use of an interactive whiteboard can also benefit those with various learning disabilities. Students have different ways of learning, some visual, audio and written, so the use of text, images and audio in a presentation can be very beneficial for the learning of some students. Interactive whiteboards can bring benefits to those with hearing impairments, visual presentations with plenty of imagery and text can really help in their learning. As well as hearing impairments, students who are partially or totally blind can highly benefit. An audio presentation can help them the most when learning. The interactive whiteboard meets the needs of many different disabilities allowing students to learn in their own way and pace.[15]</p>
    
    <p>Although interactive whiteboards can increasingly help students there are also many benefits for teachers and their lessons. Teachers can make their lessons more fun and interactive and have their lessons planned out the day before. Teachers can incorporate videos and interactive diagrams and online content, this can help with explaining some difficult information for those who struggle keeping students highly engaged with the lesson.[16] This demonstrates that interactive whiteboards increase engagement levels between the teacher and the student. With the integration of text, images and audio this can be helpful when learning vocabulary, pronunciation and geography. A word could be shown on the board with accompanying audio on how to pronounce it. Components like this can be very beneficiaI, it is a creative and fresh perspective way of learning.[17]</p>
    
    <p>Also, Interactive Desks are a new and upcoming educational tool that will possibly be used in the classroom of the future.
Researchers at Durham University (UK) TEL (Technology-Enhanced Learning) Research Group have aspired to redefine the concept of an interactive classroom, with the recent introduction of the first available multi-touch student desks.[18] They are observing how students and teachers interact and how ICT could increase collaboration. Instead of a room full of computers it will be a room full of interactive desks. With the use of interactive desks it means each child will have their own workspace and no one student will take over the whiteboard 
</p>
    
    <blockquote><p1> Professor Liz Burd of Durham University explains. "Certain sets of students who happen to be nearest the interactive [wall], can dominate it,” she says, but interactive desks ensure “fair and equal access” to learning so that children can complete the tasks set by their teacher.[19]<br>
      <cite> </cite></p1></blockquote>
    
   
    
    <p>These individual interactive desks can help children learn for themselves. Whereas a large interactive screen will allow children to work as a team.  As well as displaying work on the main screen teachers will be able to have children answer on their interactive desks. The teacher can have a live feed on each individual student and jump in if a student needs help. By 2018 this was not integrated into many schools however, the use of individual iPads have been introduced into many schools around the world, especially the UK. Having an individual iPad is the same concept of individual interactive desks. It gives all the same advantages of an interactive desk, from individual learning, linking up to the main screen, faster feedback, and collaboration with other students. iPads are the “now”, and they will most definitely play a roll in the classroom of the future. 10 years ago iPads didn’t even exist, so who knows what will exist in the next decade. Although I believe tablets will still be used in education and learning. The classroom of the future is about collaboration and anywhere learning.   </p>
